# Training Feedback Summarizer — Streamlit

This Streamlit app allows you to upload CSV/XLSX files with qualitative responses from training evaluations. It focuses on summarizing feedback around two guiding questions:

1. **What went well during the training?**
2. **What can be improved in the conduct of training?**

The app extracts major themes using TF-IDF keyword ranking and displays representative participant responses in bullet form. You can also export the generated summaries.
